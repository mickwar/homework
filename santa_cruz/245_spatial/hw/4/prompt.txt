Perform a full Bayesian analysis of the Pollutans data. This is an open-ended problem. You can consider something as simple as fitting the average annual ozone with some sensibly chosen priors. You do get bonus points for using the reference prior for the range parameter. You do need to consider model assessment to convince me that your model fits the data reasonably well. You need to write a report, of no more than 8 pages, with an abstract, an introduction to the data and methods, an EDA, explanation of the models, discussion of results, conclusions, and references. The figures need to be included in the text, and count towards the 8 pages.
